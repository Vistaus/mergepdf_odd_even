User Guide for PDF Merge Service Menu using kdialog in Plasma

Introduction:
This user guide provides instructions for using a Service Menu, developed with kdialog under the Plasma desktop environment. The Service Menu allows users to merge two PDF files: one containing odd-numbered pages scanned using a simplex Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), and the other containing even-numbered pages scanned using the same ADF. Users can select the files alternately via a dialog box, and the Service Menu merges them into a single duplex (recto-verso) PDF file. It is important to note that during the prior scanning process, the stack of pages is scanned once, then flipped and scanned again without any other modifications.

Requirements:

    Linux operating system with Plasma desktop environment
    Install the Service Menu system-wide: # cp mergepdf_odd_even.desktop /usr/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus/
    pdftk binary must be installed
    Two PDF files: one containing odd-numbered pages, and the other containing even-numbered pages
    Simplex Automatic Document Feeder (ADF) scanner or printer with ADF

Instructions:

    Locate the PDF files:
        Ensure that you have the two PDF files available: one with odd-numbered pages and the other with even-numbered pages.

    Select the PDF files using the Service Menu:
        Right-click on the odd-numbered PDF file.
        In the context menu, navigate to the "Actions".
        Look for the Merge PDFs Odd & Even option and click on it.

    Choose the even-numbered PDF file:
        A dialog box will appear, prompting you to select the PDF file containing the even-numbered pages.
        Browse or enter the path manually to locate and select the file.
        Once selected, click "Open" or press "Enter" to confirm the selection.

    Choose the odd-numbered PDF file the same way.

    Merge the PDF files:
        The Service Menu will merge the two selected PDF files into a single duplex PDF file.
        The merged file will contain both odd and even-numbered pages in the correct order.
        The resulting PDF file will be saved at the name you've chosen.
        A notification or dialog box will indicate when the merge is complete.

Note:

    Ensure that the PDF files you provide correspond to the correct scanning order (odd or even-numbered pages).
    The Service Menu assumes that the ADF scanner is set to scan in simplex mode for both odd and even-numbered pages.
    Make sure that the files you select are in PDF format and are not encrypted or password-protected.
